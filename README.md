# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Holly Tianqi Song

I'm a Ph.D. student at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by Prof. Yi-Chieh Lee in the AISG Lab. My research focuses on **virtual agents, health technology, and computational social science** within the fields of **HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work)**. Specifically, I study **human and multi-agent interaction**, exploring how multi-agent systems enhance social factors such as **human support, self-efficacy, and opinion change**.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- **Multi-Agent Systems & Group Dynamics**: Investigating how multi-agent interactions influence human perception, social influence, and decision-making.
- **Social Influence & Collective Intelligence**: Understanding how social norms and group cohesion shape human-AI collaboration.
- **Health & AI**: Exploring AI-driven interventions for **mental health, stigma reduction, and health literacy**.

## ðŸ›  Skills
- **Programming & Tools**: Python, JavaScript, LaTeX, SQL, R
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Research**: Experimental design, user studies, statistical analysis
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, statistical modeling
